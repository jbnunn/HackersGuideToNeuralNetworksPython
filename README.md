# Hacker's Guide to Neural Networks

This follows @karpathy's excellent [guide to neural nets](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/), and provides a Jupyter notebook to help readers understand the concepts (I took his JS code and converted to Python).

Karpathy's guide eventually turned into a class at Stanford, CS231n. The class notes are here: [http://cs231n.github.io/](http://cs231n.github.io/).

A lot of the compute graph and backprop details from the guide is covered in this specific class, starting about at this time: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo&t=207s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo&t=207s).
